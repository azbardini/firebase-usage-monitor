# :fire: Firebase Usage Monitor

Firebase Monitor with Slack notifications

---

### :question: About

Firebase Usage Monitor is a scrapper that uses [Firebase Profiling](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/usage/profile) to analyze Firebase usage.

By now, the script keeps track of 2 specs:

- Unindexed Queries: If any unindexed query happens while the Monitor is running, you'll get a Slack message.
- Response Latency: If any response has higher latency then the provided threshold, you'll get a Slack message.

### :arrow_upper_right: Deploying 

Firebase Usage Monitor can be deployed in basically any Linux environment.

First you'll need to fill the info needed in the first lines of `firebase_monitor.sh`.

- `secondsOfInterval` is the interval between restarting the script, it's also the interval in which you'll receive messages in Slack if there's any problem.
- `latencyThreshold` is the threshold in milliseconds for a response in Firebase, if any response has higher latency than this, you'll get a slack message.
- `firebaseProject` check FAQ.
- `firebaseToken` check FAQ.
- `slackHookURL` check FAQ.

My personal example/preference is below:

```
secondsOfInterval="300" #5 min
latencyThreshold="800"  #800 ms
firebaseProject="..."
firebaseToken="..."
slackHookURL="..."
```

#### :arrow_right_hook: How to get the Slack Hook URL? (`slackHookURL`) 

You can check the Slack tutorial about hooks [here](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks).

#### :fire: How to get the Firebase project name? (`firebaseProject`)

First, go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and log in.

There you'll find all your projects, each one with their name subtitled.

#### :key: How to get the Firebase token? (`firebaseToken`)

First you'll need to log in Firebase in terminal, asking for a token.

`firebase login:ci`

Then, access the URL provided and log in to your Google account.
If everything went fine, you'll get a Firebase token:

```
âœ”  Success! Use this token to login on a CI server:

t//exampletokenexampletoken-exampletokenexampletokenexampletoken-exampletokenexampletoken

Example: firebase deploy --token "$FIREBASE_TOKEN"
```
